# 💾 Smart Data Backup System using AWS S3, Python & GPT-4

## 📘 Overview  
This project is a smart and automated data backup system designed to securely upload files from a specified directory to an AWS S3 bucket and validate the backup using hash-based file integrity checks. It also uses GPT-4 to generate intelligent summary notifications of the backup process. Built using Python and Boto3, this solution is scalable, modular, and configuration-driven.

## 🎯 Objective  
Manual backups are error-prone and time-consuming. This project automates the process of:

- Uploading files from a local folder to an S3 bucket  
- Ensuring file integrity post-upload using MD5 hash comparison  
- Centralizing backup configurations using a `.properties` file  
- Generating AI-powered backup summary messages using GPT-4 for smart reporting

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Programming: Python  
- Cloud Platform: AWS S3  
- SDK: Boto3  
- AI Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 (via `openai` SDK)  
- Config Management: configparser & .properties file  
- Security: Hashlib (for MD5 validation)

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Configure Settings**  
Update the `config.properties` file with:
- AWS Access & Secret Keys  
- S3 Bucket Name  
- AWS Region  

### 2. **Backup Process**  
Run the `main.py` script:
- Recursively uploads all files from the target directory to S3  
- Stores and compares MD5 hashes to verify integrity of each file  
- Collects backup statistics and passes them to GPT-4 for summary generation  

### 3. **Output**  
- Console messages showing upload and integrity status  
- GPT-4 generated summary message summarizing the backup operation

## 📈 Potential Enhancements  
- Enable email or Slack notifications with GPT-generated summaries  
- Add support for incremental or scheduled backups using cron  
- Use AWS SNS or Lambda for post-backup automation  
- Extend with access frequency prediction to shift infrequent files to S3 Glacier
